pMysql –-version
mysql -u root -p
login as the root user and enter your password
secret (this is the password)

mysql>

exit;
exit us

quit;
exit us

SHOW DATABASES;
show a list of all dbs you are currently holding

CREATE DATABASE db_name;
create a database named “db_name”

USE db_name;
start using database “db_name”

DROP DATABASE db_name;
delete the database named “db_name”

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db_name.*
TO 'username'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
create privileges for a certain user
the asterisk refers to all tables in the db

SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'localhost';
shows privileges granted to the user

examples

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON widget_corp.*
TO 'widget_cms'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED BY 'secretpassword';


to enter a as a new user, the mysql console from wamp menu wont work, it will only work for the root user (password: secret), to enter as a new user go to windows powershell
and go to the /wamp/bin/mysql/mysql15.6.17/bin and type
.\mysql.exe -u widget_cms -p widget_corp
password: secretpassword

SHOW TABLES
show all the tables

CREATE TABLE table_name(
column_name1 definition,
column_name2 definition,
column_name3 definition,
);

SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name;

DROP TABLE table_name;

example:

CREATE TABLE subjects (
id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
menu_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
position INT(3) NOT NULL,
visible TINYINT(1) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (id),
);

CRUD


SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE column1 = 'some_text'
ORDER BY column1 ASC;

INSERT INTO table (colum1, column2, column3)
VALUES (val1, val2, val3)

UPDATE table
SET column1 = 'some_text'
WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM table
WHERE id = 1;


CREATE TABLE pages (
id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
subject_id INT(11) NOT NULL,
menu_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
position INT(3) NOT NULL,
visible TINYINT(1) NOT NULL,
content TEXT,
PRIMARY KEY (id),
INDEX (subject_id),
);

the index (subject_id) indicates the foreign key of this table


ESCAPTING STRINGS TO AVOID SQL INJECTION


mysqli_real_escape_string($db, $string)


PREPARED STATEMENTS TO PREVENT HAVING TO ESCAPE STRINGS

$query = “SELECT id, first_name, last_name “;
$query .= “FROM users “;
$query .= “WHERE username = ? AND password = ?”;
$stmt = mysqli_prepare($connection, $query);

mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, 'ss', $username, $password);
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
mysqli_stmt_bind_result($stmt, $id, $first_name, $last_name);
mysqli_stmt_fetch($stmt);
mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);

LOAD A PROJECT INTO MYSQL

mysql -u username –password=”secret” name_of_db_we_want_to_use < filepath/for the/database.sql

HOW TO CREATE A NEW USER – we should not try to do everything as root but rather create a new user to administer the databases.


GRANT ALL PRIVILEGEES ON database_name.*
TO 'username'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED BY 'password';


AFTER CREATING A TABLE THAT HAS A FOREIGN KEY WE NEED TO:

ALTER TABLE tablename ADD INDEX (photograph_id)

where photograph_id is the foreign key column name
