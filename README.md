# The PHP Developer Essential Package

Is a great resource for beginning and intermediate php developers.
It is Nicely complemented by my other PHP repo, The PHP Challenges Repository also in my account.

1. The Adapter Pattern
2. Tell, Don't Ask Pattern (2 examples)

5. The Decorator Pattern
6. The Strategy Pattern
7. The Observer Pattern

Soon, the Factory and Singleton Patterns will be added to this library.

## Interesting PHP Algorithms

Gathered from various sources, here you'll find ways to arrange instructions that may make you scratch your head.
This section is good training for beginner and intermediate developers looking to stretch out their algorithmic capabilities.

## MySQL

This section contains third party files with all basic SQL commands including the creation, altering, and deleteing tables,
inserting, deleting, modifying records and more advanced topics including transactions, triggers, subselects and sql
routines.

It also includes a third party pdf reference (very basic), and a subfolder with some SQL scribbles.

## PHP Functions

Simply lists off functions from the PHP manual. Right now is very bare bones and not of much use other than seeing
what's otherwise listed in the manual in separate files organized by type of function. It is intended for quick review and reference.

## Cheat Sheets

References developed by me, gathering information from around the web and web courses include
the cheat sheets for

1. Bootstrap
2. Git
3. Php Storm (for Windows)
4. Regular Expressions
5. Sublime
6. The Unix CLI Bash Commands Reference
