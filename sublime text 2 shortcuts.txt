Preferences > Settings – More > Syntax Specific User (you paste here the setting you want to apply to specific file types – like html or php)

One last place where settings can go is in your project file. If I look in my roux_website project, I've got my Sublime project file here, and if I open it that for editing, you'll see the folders that this project contains. But I can add after that list of folders a comma and then a new section called settings which will contain all of the settings that I want applied to files in this project by default. This is a great place for putting, for example, the indentation settings that you and your team have agreed on for files in this project.
